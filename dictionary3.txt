Rossetti's best-known paintings in the period 1850-1862, for example The Daydream  (1880), are of tall, thin women with pale skin and sad expressions, and they are now considered to be typical of the Pre-Raphaelite style. For many of them his model was Elizabeth Siddal, whom he married in 1860. From the middle of the 1860s his model was William Morris's  wife, Jane.
